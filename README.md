Conway's Game of Life

The program takes initial state of a grid as input. In the grid, state 1 is equivalent to a living cell,
0 - to the dead cell. The state is updated according to the rules: if a cell has less than 2 or more 
than 3 neighbours, the the cell dies; if the cell has exactly three neighbours, it is born. Only a couple
of iterations of the game are being printed as output to the console, since I haven't figured out yet how
to make a proper simulation.
